# [fit] Scientific Computing with Python

- **Science:** models in natural & social sciences (mostly biology)
- **Computation:** numerical methods & algorithms for models
- **Python:** popular programming language for scientific computing

---

# Models

- Descriptive vs Predictive
- Probability (forward, process) vs Statistics (backwards, data)
- Continuous vs Discrete (time, state)
- Mathematical vs Numerical (computational) analysis
- Deterministic (climate) vs stochastic (weather)
- Forecasting vs Inference
