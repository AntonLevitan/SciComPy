# Computational Science with Python
## An introduction to computational science with the Python programming language for computer science students

## Syllabus
Python is one of the leading programming languages for scientific
research, data science, and machine learning. The course will
familiarize students with the Python scientific stack, including NumPy,
SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, and best practices for scientific
computing. Every class will present a scientific problem, a method for
solving it, and an implementation in Python. Examples will include how
to model bacterial growth, find stationary points for a predator-prey
equation system, predict results of a tennis game, and plot a map of
hurricane density.
