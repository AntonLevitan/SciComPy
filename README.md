# Computational Science with Python
## An introduction to computational science with the Python programming language for computer science students

Python is one of the leading programming languages for scientific
research, data science, and machine learning. The course will
familiarize students with the Python scientific stack, including NumPy,
SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, and best practices for scientific
computing. Every class will present a scientific problem, a method for
solving it, and an implementation in Python. Examples will include how
to model bacterial growth, find stationary points for a predator-prey
equation system, predict results of a tennis game, and plot a map of
hurricane density.

## Classes

1. Data analysis and visualization: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn
1. Statistics: hypothesis testing, correlations, estimating distributions
1. Population dynamics: exponential, logistic and other models; curve fitting
1. Evolutionary dynamics: the Wright-Fisher model
1. Stochastic processes
1. Differential equations: ordinary, partial, stochastic
1. GLM 1: linear and poisson regression (NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)
1. GLM 2: binomial and multinomial classification (NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)
1. NN1: feed forward networks, convolutional neural networks (NumPy, SciPy, AutoGrad, Keras)
1. NN2: generative models, reinforcement learning
1. Networks
1. Optimization (minimization)
1. Linear algebra (eigenvalues?)
1. Unsupervised learning and clustering

## Preliminary Python topics

1. Concurrency in Python: threads, processes, coroutines
1. OOP
1. Memory model
1. Iteration
1. HTTP client (requests)
