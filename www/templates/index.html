        <div id="coursedesc">
          <p>
            Python is one of the leading programming languages for scientific research, data science, and machine learning. The course will familiarize students with the Python scientific stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, and best practices for scientific computing. <br>
            Every class will present a scientific problem, a method for solving it, and an implementation in Python. Examples will include how to model the spread of infectious diseases, find stationary points for a predator-prey equation system, identify an object in an image, calculate the extinction probability of a rare mutation, analyze results of a tennis game, and plot a map of hurricane density.

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="spanh">Programming skills</span><br>All class lectures and assignments will be in Python and use the Python scientific stack.
        We'll dedicate the first classes to provide an introduction to Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. If you have programming experience but in a different language (e.g. Java/C/C++/Matlab/Javascript/Ruby/Perl/R) you will probably be fine.</li>
        <li><span class="spanh">Undergraduate Calculus &amp; Linear Algebra</span><br> You should be comfortable taking derivatives and understanding matrix vector operations and notation.</li>
        <li><span class="spanh">Basic Probability and Statistics</span><br>You should know basics of probabilities, gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="qa">In general we are very open to sitting-in guests if you are a member of the IDC community (student, postdoc, staff, and/or faculty). Out of courtesy, we would appreciate that you talk to the instructor after the first class you attend. If the class is too full and we're running out of space, we would ask that you please allow registered students to attend.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qqa">
      <div class="qq">Can I work in groups for the Final Project?</div>
      <div class="qa">Yes, in groups of up to three people. See more details about the <a href="/project">Final Project</a></div>
    </div>
    <div class="qqa">
