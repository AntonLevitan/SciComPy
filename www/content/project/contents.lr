Students will complete a home exam or a short research project that applies methods and approaches discussed in the course. Code must be written in Python and submitted as a single Jupyter notebook with text, code, results, and figures.

**Note:** If you would like to submit a small research project, please email me a one-page summary of what you would like to do. 

### Grades

- The final project grade will determine 80% of the course grade:
    `final_grade = int(0.2 * assignments_grade + 0.8 * project_grade)`
- Specifically, you _cannot_ pass the course without submitting a project.
- To appeal the final project grade please submit a detailed appeal by email to the course instructor.
